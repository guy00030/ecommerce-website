<p>Tote-ally Artistic is a Ottawa based company started by two art driven people: Andrew Mckinney and Jaima Liz. Tote bags are an eco friendly way to shop these days and so why not have bags that you really want to use? These bags are great for everyday use, saves people from having to buy plastic bags and support artists. Being artists themselves, Andrew and Jaima wanted to help save the planet while also helping out other artists and making beautiful tote bags available. Who would want to buy plastic bags when these cool bags are available? Please help us support artists and encourage people to use re-usable bags!</p>
